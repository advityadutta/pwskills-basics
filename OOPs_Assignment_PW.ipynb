        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- OOP is a programming style where code is written using objects that represents real world things. It focuses on data and behavious together.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "- A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It is used to define variables and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "- An object is a real instance of a class. it uses properties and methods defined in class\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It allows you to represent essential features of an object while hiding unnecessary details. This helps in managing complexity by separating what an object does (methods) from how it achieves it (implementation details).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, known as a class. It restricts direct access to some components of an object and provides controlled access through methods. This helps in protecting the internal state of an object from unintended interference and misuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- Dunder (double underscore) methods are special methods, which allow pyhon objects to behave like built-in types. eg: __init__, __str__,__add__\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Inheritance allows one class (child) to use properties of another class (parent), which helps in code reuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Polymorphism means same method name, different behaviour. This works differently depending on object.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- using private variables (__variable__)\n",
        "- Using getters and setters\n",
        "- Controlling access to data\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Constructor is a special method called __init__, it runs automatically when an object is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Class method: works with class variables (@classmethod)\n",
        "\n",
        "- Static method: independent of class & object (@staticmethod)\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Python does not support traditional overloading (multiple methods with the same name but different parameters).\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead, it uses:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Default arguments\n",

        "- Variable-length arguments\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "- When a child class redefines a method of the parent class to change its behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- @property allows a method to be accessed like a variable, while still applying logic internally.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Because it:\n",

        "- Improves flexibility\n",
        "\n",
        "- Reduces code duplication\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "An abstract class:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "- Class Variable is shared by all objects unlike instance variable, which is unique to each object.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Class Variable is defined in class, while instance variable is defined in constructor.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "- When a class inherits from more than one parent class.\n",

        "\n",
        "- \"__del__\" is called when an object is destroyed.\n",
        "- Used for cleanup (closing files, releasing resources).\n",

        "\n",
        "- @staticmethod has no class reference, while @classmethod uses 'cls'.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Static is a utility function while class method works on class data.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Static is independent while class method is class aware.\n",

        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "- A parent method behaves differently when called by different child objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Python decides at runtime which method to call.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Method chaining means calling multiple methods in one line by returning 'self'.\n",
